## About me
I am a simple father looking to start a career in coding. I have a passion for education and mathematics. In my spare time, I like to sit down and play board games with family and friends. In fact, my next project will include a catalogue and API of boardgames, similar to my [Angular myFlix](https://github.com/zeusrahl/myFlix-Angular-client) and [React myFlix](https://github.com/zeusrahl/myFlix-Client) app.
