### Welcome to my GitHub! Feel free to look through some of my projects I built.

## About me
I am a simple father looking to start a career in coding. I have a passion for education and mathematics. In my spare time, I like to sit down and play board games with family and friends. 

I currently work on developing a Web App to assist teachers in Standards Based Grading, focusing my skills on developing back-end code to set, get, update, and delete data from our NoSQL database.
